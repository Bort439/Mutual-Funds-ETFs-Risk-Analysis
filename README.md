# Mutual-Funds-vs-ETFs-Risk-Analysis
Welcome to my first GitHub project! This project aims to calculate the risks associated with Mutual Funds and ETFs, and determine wich method is more efficient. The focus of this project is on data analysis, and I am still at the beginning of my learning journey, so I am open to tips and suggestions (please leave me some feedback and advice, I've many doubts about calculating risk indicators. Thanks) . Thank you for visiting my project!
Remember that the data I imported aren't verified, and this project it's just a way to exercise
