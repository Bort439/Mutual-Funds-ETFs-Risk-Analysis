# Venture-Capital-vs-Mutual-Funds-Risk-Analysis
Welcome to my first GitHub project! This project aims to calculate the risks associated with Venture Capital and Mutual Funds, and determine which method is better. The focus of this project is on data analysis, and I am still at the beginning of my learning journey, so I am open to tips and suggestions (please leave me some feedback and advice, I've many doubts about calculating risk indicators. Thanks) . Thank you for visiting my project!
